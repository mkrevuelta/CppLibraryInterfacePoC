# CppLibraryInterfacePoC
A library Proof of Concept with:
+ Mostly C++ interface (objects, move semantics)
+ Easy to write (real C++, *no* conversion to/from plain old C)
+ Easy to use (objects are given away, managed by unique pointers)
+ Highly compatible across compiler versions from a given vendor (only requirement: C++11 or above)

This repository will contain evolved versions of the examples I proposed in this presentation:
